# FinTech Case Study 

## Landscape

##### The FinTech domain I'd like to focus on is capital management of private and public companies of all sizes. This industry has always fascinated me, since from the very beginning I’ve been interested in the equity markets, especially the private side. 

##### The exciting part of this industry is despite it growing so fast the adoption in FinTech (within the US and the world) is still relatively low.

## Overview and Origin

![image.png](attachment:ab893f35-46a0-4be9-ad10-290200fd0da4.png)

* ##### Name of the company: 
Carta  

* ##### When was the company incorporated? 
2012 

* ##### Who are the founders of the company? 
Henry Ward and Manu Kumar 

* ##### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
Carta was created out of a need to bring and outdated industry up to speed with the modern world. Startups creating their equity programs covering cap table management, 409A valuations, liquidity, and administration all faced excessive legal fees and trouble managing the program. By creating a platform that covered all aspects, it let companies focus on what really mattered for them. This created a simple interface for companies to distribute and administer shares, making the process more transparent for the company’s employees. 

* ##### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
Carta has had 17 funding rounds with their latest being February 4th, 2021, which was a secondary market round. The total funds raised from all the funding rounds comes out to $627.8 Million.

* ##### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Carta has set up their company as a SaaS model, where you are able to scale up and grow your features as the company grows. Their intended customer ranges from early startups up to IPO ready companies.

When looking up competitors to Carta the names that come up are Captable.io, EquityZen, and E*Trade. Each one focuses on slightly different scales and areas. For example, EquitZen focuses more on giving access to shareholders to sell their equity for cash, even while their company is private. Captable.io resembles Carta model the most. However, one major area that differentiates the two is, Carta uses an in-house team and leverages the cap table data to produce a 409A unlike Captable.io, who outsources their valuations.

Extra competition coming: There is a recent startup (just 14 months old) making a name for themselves as the company to take on Carta. They are focusing on having a quicker process, cheaper price, and better tools. In case you are interested in learning more here is a link to the article that highlights their story. https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-serial-founder-is-taking-on-carta-with-cap-table-management-software-she-says-is-better-for-founders/

* ##### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
When it comes to Carta's technology and services, they use a number of products, just to list a few of them: HTML5, Google Analytics, JQuery, Google Optimize 360, Google Universal Analytics, Google Conversion Tracking, Twitter Analytics, and Facebook Pixel. They use up to 62 different technology products that all feed into their product line. 
In addition, Carta has registered 6 trademarks that make them unique. The most popular class of their patents is "scientific and electric apparatus and instruments" according to IPqwery.

## Results

* ##### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Over the past 9 years Carta has been trusted by over 17,000 companies to solve their capital management problems. The company I work for is one of those who uses their platform today. They have disrupted this industry leading to different companies coming in to focus on different parts and niches (such as the selling of shares on the private market, which CartaX is being developed to tackle that area as well).

* ##### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Beyond the cap table management and 409A valuations other metrics or areas that Carta is focused on is offering liquidity for shareholders, streamline board approvals/investor updates, generating form 3921 for the IRS, and being audit-ready for accounting. 

* ##### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Currently Carta stands as the leading company in the cap table management space with 79.44% market share. (resource 8) 

## Recommendations

* ##### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
This offering would benefit the company in multiple ways. It creates an extra value proposition that other companies do not currently have. Being able to differentiate yourself will be key to maintaining the large market share Carta currently has. In addition, this can be an added feature to create additional revenue. Since they are a SaaS company, having different tiers will allow the companies that want this feature to pay for it. 

* ##### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This offering would benefit the company in multiple ways. It creates an extra value proposition that other companies don't currently have. Being able to differentiate yourself will be key to maintaining the market share they have. 

* ##### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? And why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
This new product would require the resources to create online learning materials, from articles to online classes. Having the infrastructure to store and create this will be additional technology needed. In addition, if you have live consultants working with employees you will need video conference technology (such as zoom) that allows them to connect, and a platform for the employees to schedule meetings with them.
